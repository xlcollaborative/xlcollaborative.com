    <h3 id="resignation">Resignation</h3>
    <p>Any contributor may resign at any time by <a href="#circulating-messages">circulating</a> a message of resignation.

    <h3 id="sublicensing">Sublicensing</h3>
    <p>Any contributor may give a sublicense within thirty calendar days of securing <a href="#majority">majority approval</a>. When <a href="#soliciting-votes">soliciting votes</a> for a sublicense, a contributor must <a href="#circulating-messages">circulate</a>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>identification of the contributor proposing to give the sublicense</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>an exact copy of all the proposed sublicense terms</p>

      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Contributors may give sublicenses to specific recipients, a categories of recipients, or the public as a whole. Sublicenses may allow sublicensing in turn. Sublicenses must apply from the time the sublicense is given, or from a time stated in the terms, not retroactively.</p>
    <h2 id="communications">Communications</h2>
    <h3 id="equal-information">Equal Information</h3>
    <p>Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to receive each message sent to any other contributor under these terms.</p>
    <h3 id="circulating-messages">Circulating Messages</h3>
    <p>To circulate a message under these terms, a contributor must send the message in the English language to each other contributor, <a href="#retry">retrying</a> as necessary.</p>
    <h3 id="circulating-notices">Circulating Notices</h3>
    <p>Any contributor who receives a notice message under the terms of a sublicense must <a href="#circulating-messages">circulate</a> that notice, <a href="#retrying">retrying</a> as necessary.</p>
    <h3 id="addresses">Addresses</h3>
    <p>The first and second contributors must agree on a global, free or low-cost, high-speed, electronic communication system, such as e-mail, and provide addresses for that system. Later contributors must provide addresses for the same system.</p>
    <h3 id="change-of-address">Change of Address</h3>
    <p>Any contributor may change their address by <a href="#circulating-messages">circulating</a> their new address from their current address. Alternatively, any contributor may change their address by <a href="#circulating-messages">circulating</a> their new address from a different address and securing <a href="#supermajority">supermajority approval</a>, without any opposing message from the address to be replaced.</p>
    <h2 id="voting">Voting</h2>
    <h3 id="equal-vote">Equal Vote</h3>
    <p>Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to cast a single, equal vote on each proposal under these terms.</p>
    <h3 id="majority">Majority</h3>
    <p>For majority approval, a majority of responding contributors must vote in favor.</p>
    <h3 id="supermajority">Supermajority</h3>
    <p>For supermajority approval, two thirds of responding contributors must vote in favor.</p>
    <h3 id="counting">Counting</h3>
    <p>The contributor soliciting approval counts as a contributor voting in favor.</p>
    <h3 id="deadline">Deadline</h3>
    <p>The deadline for approval of any proposal is thirty calendar days from when <a href="#soliciting-votes">votes were first solicited</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="securing-approval">Securing Approval</h3>
    <p>To secure an approval, a contributor must <a href="#soliciting-votes">solicit votes</a>, then <a href="#tallying-votes">tally votes</a>, and finally <a href="#reporting-results">report the result</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="soliciting-votes">Soliciting Votes</h3>
    <p>To solicit votes, a contributor must <a href="#circulating-messages">circulate</a> a single message with all of these details:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>the identity of the project</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the complete text of the proposal</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the voting standard required</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the <a href="#deadline">deadline</a></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="casting-votes">Casting Votes</h3>
    <p>Contributors may vote by replying to a message soliciting votes using the same communication system. Messages like “I approve.”, “I vote in favor.”, and “Aye” indicate a vote in favor. Messages like “I oppose.”, “I vote against.”, and “Nay” indicate a vote against.</p>
    <h3 id="tallying-votes">Tallying Votes</h3>
    <p>To tally votes, the contributor who solicited votes must ensure that each vote message is <a href="#circulating-messages">circulated</a>. If the communication system enables forwarding messages verbatim, such as by forwarding e-mail, the contributor must forward vote messages verbatim. If a voting contributor <a href="#circulating-messages">circulates</a> their vote themself, the contributor soliciting votes does not have to <a href="#circulating-messages">circulate</a> it again.</p>
    <h3 id="reporting-results">Reporting Results</h3>
    <p>To report a result, the contributor who solicited votes must <a href="#circulating-messages">circulate</a> a single message with all of these details within seven calendar days after the <a href="#deadline">deadline</a>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>all the information required to <a href="#soliciting-votes">solicit votes</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>copies of all <a href="#voting">vote messages</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>counts of votes in favor, votes against, and contributors not responding by the <a href="#deadline">deadline</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>whether contributors approved the proposal or not</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="payments">Payments</h2>
    <h3 id="equal-pay">Equal Pay</h3>
    <p>Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to receive an equal share of license fees for the project. Any sublicense that entitles any contributor to payment must require payment to the contributor who gave the sublicense to start, and to any successor for which any contributor secures <a href="#majority">majority approval</a> after.</p>
    <h3 id="distributing-payments">Distributing Payments</h3>
    <p>Any contributor who receives payment under a sublicense must pay other contributors their <a href="#equal-pay">equal shares</a> of funds received within fourteen calendar days, according to their <a href="#payment-instructions">payment instructions</a>, <a href="#retry">retrying</a> as necessary.</p>
    <h3 id="payment-processing-fees">Payment Processing Fees</h3>
    <p>If a contributor’s <a href="#payment-instructions">payment instructions</a> require the distributing contributor to pay a fee, the contributor making the payment may reduce the amount of the payment by the amount of the fee, so the distributing contributor does not have to pay any processing fees out of pocket.</p>
    <h3 id="failed-payment">Failed Payments</h3>
    <p>If a contributor does not respond to a payment of their share, the next step depends on the amount of their share.</p>
    <p>If the amount is ten percent or less of the payment under the sublicense, or the payment processing fees would be 50% or more of the amount, then the distributing contributor may keep the amount for themself.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, the distributing contributor must try to pay themself and other contributors, but not the contributor that is not responding, equal shares of the amount, according to their <a href="#payment-instructions">payment instructions</a>. If those payments fail, the distributing contributor does not have to <a href="#retry">retry</a> them, but can keep the amounts for themself.</p>
    <h3 id="payment-instructions">Payment Instructions</h3>
    <p>Contributors must provide payment instructions for global, low-cost, high-speed, electronic payment systems.</p>
    <h3 id="change-of-payment-instructions">Change of Payment Instructions</h3>
    <p>Any contributor may change their <a href="#payment-instructions">payment instructions</a> by <a href="#circulating-messages">circulating</a> new <a href="#payment-instructions">payment instructions</a> from their current <a href="#addresses">address</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="retry">Retry</h2>
    <p>When a <a href="#communications">communication</a> or <a href="#payments">payment</a> system fails to deliver a message or payment:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The sending contributor must <a href="#circulating-messages">circulate</a> word of the failure and any failure message from the system.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The sending contributor must wait 48 hours, then try again. If the receiving contributor <a href="#change-of-address">changed</a> their <a href="#address">address</a> or <a href="#change-of-payment-instructions">changed</a> their <a href="#payment-instructions">payment instructions</a> since the first try, the sending contributor must use the new <a href="#address">address</a> or <a href="#payment-instructions">payment instructions</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the second try also fails, the sending contributor must <a href="#circulating-messages">circulate</a> word of the failure and any failure message from the system. The receiving contributor is then considered to be not responding.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
    <p>Any contributor may change these terms by securing <a href="#supermajority">supermajority approval</a> in favor of the change. Changes apply from the time of approval going forward, not retroactively.</p>
    <h2 id="no-liability">No Liability</h2>
    <p><em><strong>As far as the law allows, the project comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to any other contributor for any damages related to the project or these terms, under any kind of legal claim.</strong></em></p>
